# Password Generator 

## Generate a custom, secure password between 8 and 128 characters. 

This is a simple password generating application that makes use of JavaScript popups and functions. The most secure password is a randomized one, and this application takes user preferences and creates that password for them. The user gets to specify how many characters their password is, as well as if they would like uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. The user may generate as many passwords as they like with a single click of a button. 

The application also validates the input data, and the user will be reprompted until they request a password that is between 8 and 128 characters and includes at least one type of character.
